# Descriptin
Nowadays health diseases are increasing day by day due to various reasons i.e. our life styles, smoking, drinking [1]. Peoples of all over the world are suffering from various health diseases and heart attack is one of them. Nowadays heart disease is the biggest cause of death in the worldwide. This research paper focuses on developing a system that can predict the possibilities of heart attack disease with the help of data mining and machine learning algorithms. The outcome of this system provides the possibilities rate of heart disease in percentage. The datasets that are used in the system are classified in the terms of medical parameters. The datasets are processed in Python Programming using two Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms namely K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm and Random Forest Algorithm which shows the best accuracy level of heart disease prediction.
# Abstract
Nowadays health diseases are increasing day by day due to various reasons i.e. our life styles, smoking, drinking [1]. Peoples of all over the world are suffering from various health diseases and heart attack is one of them. Nowadays heart disease is the biggest cause of death in the worldwide. This research paper focuses on developing a system that can predict the possibilities of heart attack disease with the help of data mining and machine learning algorithms. The outcome of this system provides the possibilities rate of heart disease in percentage. The datasets that are used in the system are classified in the terms of medical parameters. The datasets are processed in Python Programming using two Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms namely K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm and Random Forest Algorithm which shows the best accuracy level of heart disease prediction.
